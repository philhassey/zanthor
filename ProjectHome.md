A game that involves controlling a living moving castle.

Squash peasants, by crushing them with your castle... or shoot them with your steam powered cannon.

Did I mention that your castle(Zanthor) is powered by steam?  So you need to collect coal, and water to power Zanthor.

Squash peasants on different levels, and then upgrade your castle with better engines, and bigger cannons (amongst other upgrades).
